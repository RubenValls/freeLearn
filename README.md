- __Administration Area:__ Administrators have an easy-to-use interface to manage and keep the course catalog updated. They can add new courses, update information, and ensure the quality of the presented content.
- __Student Area:__ Users have access to an intuitive, straightforward, and personalized space where they can modify their user data, review instructor profiles, explore available technologies and courses, watch lessons directly on the platform, and mark their favorite courses.


## 🚀 Development server

Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## ⌨️ Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## 📦 Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## ✅ Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## ☑️ Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
